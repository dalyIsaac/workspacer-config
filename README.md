# Workspacer config

This is my config for [workspacer](https://workspacer.org/). It should still work, given workspacer has been relatively stable for a while now.

However, I have since moved on to developing [Whim](https://github.com/dalyIsaac/Whim), another tiling window manager, which you can find at <https://github.com/dalyIsaac/Whim>. It is still in development, but I am using it as my daily driver.
